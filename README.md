# Godot Test RPG
A test RPG built with Godot while learning Godot

## User Stories
I want to establish some goals for this test RPG
so I can avoid going on wild tangents and burning out on this test project.

I'm going to use User Stories, because I want to see how well that works for game development.

Here are User Stories (work in progress):
* [x] When I start the game, I want to be greated with a title screen
* [x] When on the title screen, I want an obvious exit button to close the game properly
* [x] When on the title screen, I want to be able to start the game
* [ ] I want to be able to explore the world
* [ ] When exploring, I want to be able to enter at least one building
* [ ] When exploring, I want to be able to avoid battles that aren't important for the "story"
* [ ] When exploring, I want to be able to find items
* [ ] I want to be able to fight baddies
* [ ] When fighting, I want to know how close to losing I am (player HP is visible)
